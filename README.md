# Ruby-Projects

This may only have one project in it. But this is more of an example of my ability to learn new languages in a short amount of time. In my Scripting Language class we had to chose a previous project from someone else and build it out in a scripting language we've never used before. For this project i chose to re-code a project from a classmate who built a simple four function calculator. This taught me how quickly i can research and figure out how a different language works. This took me only 30 minutes to build out.
